            <p>
            Welcome to "Pennies for Pawsitivity" â€“ the ultimate crowdfunding platform dedicated to spreading love, hope, and care for our feline friends. 
            Our mission is to empower not-for-profit organisations that are tirelessly working to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome cats in need. 
            At "Pennies for Pawsitivity," we believe in the power of small contributions to create monumental change. 
            Every penny donated goes directly towards transforming the lives of a kitten or cat in need. 
            Our platform connects the organisations that pour their heart and soul into giving every cat a chance at a brighter future with compassionate and enthusiastic cat lovers with small change to spare.
